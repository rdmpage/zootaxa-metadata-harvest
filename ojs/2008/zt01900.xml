        <title locale="en_US">A checklist of the satyrine genus &lt;i&gt;Erebia &lt;/i&gt;(Lepidoptera) (17582006)</title>
        <abstract locale="en_US">Since BCS Warren’s seminal Monograph of the circumpolar satyrine butterfly genus &lt;i&gt;Erebia&lt;/i&gt; Dalman, 1816, was published in 1936, more than 320 new names and some 200 papers dealing wholly or in large part with the genus have been published. A modern checklist of more than 1,300 names proposed for butterflies of the genus &lt;i&gt;Erebia&lt;/i&gt; (sensu &lt;i&gt;stricto),&lt;/i&gt; all of which have been checked at source, is presented together with the source publication and type locality (TL). Also presented is a bibliography of 1,200 published items concerning the genus. The checklist covers the period 1758–2006; such names proposed and papers published as have been noted after the 31st of December 2006 are also included.</abstract>
