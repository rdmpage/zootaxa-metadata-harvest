<h3>Literature analysis and present state of knowledge of benthic Medusozoa (Cnidaria) from the Bay of Biscay and nearby areas (northeastern Atlantic), with emphasis on biodiversity</h3>
<i>Avaro Altuna</i><h4>Pages: 1-26</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The literature on benthic Medusozoa (Cnidaria) from the Bay of Biscay and nearby areas (roughly between 42º–48º30’ N and 2°–10º W) is reviewed. Some 213 papers have been inventoried and classified in 17 groups based on their main contents. The present state of knowledge is analyzed, and papers covering each administrative territory of both adjacent countries, Spain and France, are listed. Around 2000, the accumulative curve of new papers and new records reached its ceiling. Some 205 species are known, with the suborder Conica (class Hydrozoa, order Leptothecata) accounting for the highest number of species (110), while the Proboscoida (Hydrozoa: Leptothecata), Filifera and Capitata (both Hydrozoa: Anthoathecata) account for much fewer species (21, 32 and 27 respectively). Only a few species are referable to the remaining subtaxa of Medusozoa, <i>i.e.</i> four to class Staurozoa, six to class Scyphozoa, four to subclass Trachylina (Hydrozoa), and one to order Limnomedusae (Hydrozoa). Species of suborders Capitata and Filifera (Hydrozoa, order Anthoathecata) will probably monopolize new discoveries of species. Knowledge of biodiversity is uneven amongst the different administrative provinces, with Guipúzcoa having the highest number of reported species (111 species, 54% of those known from the whole study area). Little information is available for certain areas, especially the French coasts. The fauna of every Spanish province has been the subject of MSc or PhD taxonomy-targeted research, but no such studies have been undertaken along the French coast. In Spain, the littoral fauna of Cantabria merits more intensive study because it represents an interface between the “cold” southwestern (from Asturias to Pontevedra) and “warm” southeastern (from Vizcaya to Gironde) areas of the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<h3><i>Periclimenes aqabai </i>sp. nov, a further species of the <i>aesopius </i>species group (Caridea: Pontoniinae) from the Red Sea</h3>
<i>A. J. Bruce</i><h4>Pages: 27-32</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A new species of pontoniine shrimp from the Red Sea, <i>Periclimenes</i> <i>aqabai</i> sp. nov., is designated. A member of the <i>aesopius</i> species group, the species was originally identified as <i>Periclimenes</i> <i>holthuisi.</i></p>

<h3>Description of a new genus and two new species of labeonine fishes from South China (Teleostei: Cyprinidae)</h3>
<i>E Zhang</i>, <i>Xin Qiang</i>, <i>Jia-Hu Lan</i><h4>Pages: 33-44</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A new genus and two new species are described from the Pearl River drainage in Guangxi Province, South China. <i>Hongshuia,</i> new genus, can be distinguished from all other Asian genera of the Labeonini by having a lower lip with its median lobe modified into a round, fleshy plate peripherally greatly protruded so as to form a ring-like fold that is posteromedially continuous with the mental region, and centrally sunken so as to form a round, flat, fleshy pad. This genus is distinct from all other Asian labeonine genera of the Garrina except for one newly described species of <i>Parasinilabeo</i> (P. <i>longibarbus),</i> <i>Pseudocrossocheilus,</i> and <i>Sinocrossocheilus,</i> in the presence of well-developed maxillary barbels. <i>Hongshuia</i> differs from the above three genera in the lower lip morphology, and further from both <i>Pseudocrossocheilus</i> and <i>Qianlabeo</i> in the number of pharyngeal tooth rows and from <i>Sinocrossocheilus</i> in the colour pattern. Two new species, <i>H.</i> <i>banmo</i> and <i>H.</i> <i>paoli,</i> differ in the distribution density and degree of development of papillae on the rostral fold, depth of indentations on the distal edge of the rostral fold, presence or absence of papillae on the lower lip, size and shape of tubercles on the tip of the snout and anterior portion of the lachrymal, length, position and colour pattern of the dorsal fin, and snout length.</p>

<h3>Overview of Sididae (Crustacea: Cladocera: Ctenopoda) of Northeast and East Thailand, with description of a new species of the genus <i>Diaphanosoma</i></h3>
<i>Nikolai M. Korovchinsky</i>, <i>La-Orsri Sanoamuang</i><h4>Pages: 45-61</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The investigation of an extensive collection of zooplankton samples from Northeast and East Thailand has revealed 10 species of the family Sididae, members of which often were mostly frequently distributed and abundant among Cladocera. Of seven species of the genus <i>Diaphanosoma,</i> one is new to science (D. <i>elongatum</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.)</b> and two others, <i>D.</i> <i>senegal</i> and <i>D.</i> <i>macrophthalma,</i> new to Thailand. The genus <i>Pseudosida</i> is represented by <i>P.</i> <i>szalayi</i> instead of <i>P.</i> <i>bidentata</i> incorrectly recorded previously. Eleven species of Sididae are now known from Northeast Thailand and 12 from the whole country. The highest frequency occurrence and abundance were observed in <i>D.</i> <i>excisum,</i> <i>D.</i> <i>dubium,</i> <i>Latonopsis</i> <i>australis,</i> and <i>P.</i> <i>szalayi</i> while other species were more infrequent (D. <i>sarsi)</i> or rare. Sididae species were often observed co-occurring in different combinations, among them up to three-four species of <i>Diaphanosoma.</i> The rare species <i>D.</i> <i>senegal</i> frequently co-occurred with large Branchiopoda. Most Sididae of Northeast Thailand are of tropical origin while others (D. <i>dubium,</i> <i>D.</i> <i>macrophthalma,</i> <i>Sida</i> <i>crystallina)</i> have penetrated here from more northern latitudes.</p>

<h3>A new species and two new record species of genus <i>Allokepon </i>Markham, 1982 (Isopoda: Epicaridea: Bopyridae) from China</h3>
<i>Jiangyan Duan</i>, <i>Jianmei An</i>, <i>Haiyan Yu</i><h4>Pages: 62-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Descriptions of a new species and two new records of species of the genus <i>Allokepon</i> Markham, 1982 from Chinese waters are presented. The host species were portunid crabs. <i>Allokepon</i> <i>hendersoni</i> (Giard & Bonnier 1887) was found infesting <i>Charybdis</i> <i>bimaculata</i> (Miers), <i>A.</i> <i>monodi</i> (Bourdon, 1967) infesting <i>Portunus</i> <i>pelagicus</i> (L), <i>Portunus</i> <i>trituberculatus</i> (Miers), and <i>Thalamita</i> sp. and <i>A.</i> <i>longicauda</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> infesting <i>Portunus</i> <i>pulchricristatus</i> (Gorden). Three of the host species were recorded for the first time harboring isopod parasites, and the male of <i>A.</i> <i>monodi</i> is presented. <i>Allokepon</i> <i>longicauda</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> is distinguished from the other four species found in China by the long slender uropods of females.</p>
