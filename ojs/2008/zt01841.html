<h3>At the lower size limit in snakes: two new species of threadsnakes (Squamata: Leptotyphlopidae: <i>Leptotyphlops</i>) from the Lesser Antilles</h3>
<i>S. Blair Hedges</i><h4>Pages: 1-30</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Islands are viewed as natural evolutionary laboratories for terrestrial organisms because they have boundaries that limit dispersal and often reveal evolutionary patterns and mechanisms. One such pattern is that the smallest and largest species of different types of tetrapod animals are frequently found on islands. Here I describe two new diminutive species of snakes of the genus <i>Leptotyphlops</i> from the Lesser Antilles: one from Saint Lucia and the other from Barbados. The one from Barbados is the smallest species of snake and has a total adult length of approximately 100 mm. Limited evidence indicates a clutch size of one and a greatly elongated egg shape (length /width). Comparison of egg shapes in snakes indicates that the shape is a packaging phenomenon, related primarily to the shape of the available body cavity and clutch size. For a clutch size of one, expected egg shape is eight whereas expected egg shape drops to two at a clutch size of ten. The body shape of snakes, defined as snout-to-vent length divided by width, also varies and influences the shape of snake eggs. The smallest snakes are typically stout-bodied with shapes of 30–35 whereas the longest snakes usually are more elongate, with shapes of 45–50. The allometry of organ size also affects clutch size and shape, because the smallest snakes have the smallest proportion of body cavity space available for reproduction. The best explanation for the observation of body size extremes on islands is that colonizing species have adapted to open ecological niches that would otherwise be occupied on the mainland. Island colonists encounter novel environments and reduced interspecific competition, allowing species to evolve physical traits, including extremes in size, not normally seen on continents. However, the lower limit of adult size appears to be constrained by the allometry of morphology, physiology, and reproduction. The smallest tetrapods have small clutches, usually one egg or young, and offspring that are relatively large. In the smallest snakes, offspring are one-half of the length of adults, compared with 10% adult length in the case of large species of snakes. Thus the evolutionary tradeoff between number and size of offspring appears to have reached a size boundary in these species, limiting the evolution of yet smaller species.</p>

<h3>Specimens of Galatheidae (Crustacea: Decapoda) collected by N.Pq. "Soloncy Moura" off the Southern Coast of Brazil under the Revizee Program </h3>
<i>Gustavo A. Schmidt De Melo-Filho</i><h4>Pages: 31-42</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The purpose of this work was to analyze the distribution patterns of the species belonging to the family Galatheidae collected under the Revizee Program (Living Resources in the Exclusive Economic Zone) off the Brazilian Southern Coast. The study area extended from the Baía da Guanabara (Rio de Janeiro; 23°43’S) south to Ilha de Santa Catarina (Santa Catarina; 27°22’S). The collections were made during several cruises of N.Pq. “Soloncy Moura” between August 2001 and April 2002 over the shelf and slope (101–604 m). One species of the genus <i>Agononida,</i> five species of <i>Munida,</i> and one species of <i>Munidopsis</i> were collected. The general distribution patterns of the species are discussed.</p>

<h3>A new, first fossil species of <i>Ophioderma</i> Mhller and Troschel, 1842 (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea) (Late Miocene, Argentina)</h3>
<i>Sergio Martinez</i>, <i>Claudia J. Del Rio</i><h4>Pages: 43-52</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A new species of <i>Ophioderma</i> Müller and Troschel, 1842 is described. The new species is the first fossil one of the genus, and the third ophiuroid described for the Tertiary of South America. It is characterized by its large size, proximal dorsal arm plates arched, entire or irregularly fragmented in two or three parts and lateral arm plates with four or five short, flat spines of similar length with a finger-like outline.</p>

<h3>A new species of the genus <i>Tithaeus</i> from China (Arachnida: Laniatores: Epedanidae)</h3>
<i>Wei-Guang Lian</i>, <i>Ming-Sheng Zhu</i>, <i>Adriano B. Kury</i><h4>Pages: 53-60</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The genus <i>Tithaeus</i> Thorell, 1891 is newly recorded from China with a new species: <i>T.</i> <i>drac,</i> based on specimens collected from Guangxi Province. The new record represents an expansion of 700 km to the northeast of the known range of the genus. The taxonomic status of the genus <i>Tithaeus</i> is discussed, based on external and male genital morphology.</p>
