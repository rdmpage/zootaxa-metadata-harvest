<h3>Insects found in birds' nests from Argentina: <i>Anumbius annumbi</i> (Vieillot, 1817) (Aves: Furnariidae)</h3>
<i>Paola Turienzo</i>, <i>Osvaldo Di Iorio</i><h4>Pages: 1-55</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Insects found in the nests of <i>Anumbius</i> <i>annumbi</i> (Vieillot) [Aves: Furnariidae] from the provinces of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Entre Ríos, and La Pampa (Argentina) were studied. A total of 20 nests was sampled every 21 days in Buenos Aires, together with the insects found under ritidome of <i>Eucalyptus</i> in the same area. Samples from nests were divided by seasons: end of summer [nest 1]; autumn [nests 2 to 6]; winter [nests 7 to 12]; spring [nests 13 to 16]; summer [nests 17 to 19], and beginning of autumn [nest 20]. A total of 92 species of insects was found, of which only 36 species had been previously reported in the literature from 1943 until 2005. Additional nests were sampled from Santa Fe (3 nests), Entre Ríos (1 nest), and La Pampa (4 nests). Species richness, abundance and diversity per nest are given and discussed. Insects in birds´nests are classified according to their functional guilds (predators; hematophages and parasitoids; detritivores; phytophages and fungivorous); degree of permanence in the nests (temporal inhabitants [hibernants]; permanent inhabitants; accidentals and/or occasionals). Mortality among the insect fauna inside the nests and other dead insects found inside nests, probably prey remains, are cited. The insect fauna under the ritidome of <i>Eucalyptus</i> permits establishment of a habitat gradient: species only found in the nests, species mainly found in the nests and rarely under the ritidome, species found both under the ritidome and in the nests, species mainly found under ritidome and seldom in the nests, and species only found under the ritidome. Comments and remarks are made on selected taxa lacking or with limited biological data. The microhabitat in the tunnels of <i>Ctenomys</i> [Rodentia] is compared with the birds’nests regarding its similar insect fauna. Inquiline birds and mammals are also mentioned.</p>

<h3>A new species of <i>Augustinus</i> Korotyaev from China, with a key to the species groups of the genus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Ceutorhynchinae)</h3>
<i>Junhao Huang</i>, <i>Hiraku Yoshitake</i>, <i>Runzhi Zhang</i>, <i>Motomi Ito</i><h4>Pages: 63-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p><i>Augustinus</i> <i>tuberculatus</i> Huang, Yoshitake & Zhang, <b>sp.</b> <b>n.,</b> is described from Guizhou Province, southwestern China. The species is readily distinguishable from its congeners by the prothorax having five pairs of tubercles in addition to paired median prominences. We classify the species into a new species group, the <i>A.</i> <i>tuberculatus</i> group, based mainly on the basally convex rostrum, elytral interval 1 with a velvety black scaly patch in the basal 1/3, interval 3 with a large obtuse tubercle in the middle (with 1–3 rows of setiferous granules), the posterior margin of ventrite 2 angularly produced in the middle and the anterior and posterior margins of ventrite 4 equidistant along their entire length. A key to the species groups of <i>Augustinus</i> is provided.</p>
