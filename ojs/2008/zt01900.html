<h3>A checklist of the satyrine genus <i>Erebia </i>(Lepidoptera) (17582006)</h3>
<i>W John Tennent</i><h4>Pages: 1-109</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Since BCS Warren’s seminal Monograph of the circumpolar satyrine butterfly genus <i>Erebia</i> Dalman, 1816, was published in 1936, more than 320 new names and some 200 papers dealing wholly or in large part with the genus have been published. A modern checklist of more than 1,300 names proposed for butterflies of the genus <i>Erebia</i> (sensu <i>stricto),</i> all of which have been checked at source, is presented together with the source publication and type locality (TL). Also presented is a bibliography of 1,200 published items concerning the genus. The checklist covers the period 1758–2006; such names proposed and papers published as have been noted after the 31st of December 2006 are also included.</p>
