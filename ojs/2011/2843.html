<h3>Taxonomy of Afrotropical and West Palaearctic ants of the ponerine genus Hypoponera Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) </h3>
<i>Barry Bolton</i>, <i>Brian L. Fisher</i><h4>Pages: 1-118</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The taxonomy of the ponerine ants of the genus <i>Hypoponera</i> is revised for the Afrotropical and West Palaearctic regions. A combined key to both faunae is presented, and the West Palaearctic species are also keyed separately. Fifty-six species are recognised in total, of which 51 are Afrotropical endemics and two are restricted to the West Palaearctic; three tramp species occur in both regions. Thirty-four Afrotropical species are described as new while 33 names, including a number of infraspecific taxa and extralimital forms, are relegated to synonymy. Two previously described Afrotropical <i>Hypoponera</i> names are regarded as <i>species</i> <i>inquirendae</i> (lea, <i>petiolata).</i> Two extralimital species are mentioned with respect to the studied fauna: <i>gibbinota,</i> described from a casual introduction in a Palaearctic hothouse, and the Oriental <i>assmuthi,</i> which is provisionally raised to species to dissociate it from the Palaearctic <i>abeillei,</i> to which it was previously linked as an infraspecific taxon.</p>
