<h3>Two new species of the Glyptosternine catfish genus <i>Euchiloglanis</i> (Teleostei: Sisoridae) from southwest China with redescriptions of <i>E. davidi </i>and <i>E. kishinouyei</i></h3>
<i>Wei Zhou</i>, <i>Xu Li</i>, <i>Alfred W. Thomson</i><h4>Pages: 1-18</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Two new species of the sisorid catfish genus <i>Euchiloglanis</i> are described from the upper Yangtze River and the upper Black River drainage (Red River basin) in China. <i>Euchiloglanis</i> <i>longibarbatus</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> from the upper Yangtze River differs from <i>E.</i> <i>davidi,</i> <i>E.</i> <i>kishinouyei</i> and <i>E.</i> <i>longus</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> by having an elongate and threadlike maxillary barbel with a pointed tip reaching posteriorly to beyond the gill opening. It differs from <i>E.</i> <i>dorsoarcus</i> by having the anal-fin origin closer to the caudal-fin base than to the pelvic-fin origin, and from <i>E.</i> <i>phongthoensis</i> by having the anus located midway between the pelvic-fin insertion and the anal-fin origin. <i>Euchiloglanis</i> <i>longus</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> from the upper Black River drainage differs from <i>E.</i> <i>davidi</i> by having the length of the pectoral fin equal to 78.4–89.5% of the distance between the origins of the pectoral and pelvic fins, and from <i>E.</i> <i>kishinouyei</i> and <i>E.</i> <i>longibarbatus</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> by having the distance between the origins of the pelvic and anal fins equal to 108.9–140.6% of the distance between the origins of the pectoral and pelvic fins. It further differs from <i>E.</i> <i>davidi,</i> <i>E.</i> <i>kishinouyei,</i> and <i>E.</i> <i>longibarbatus</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> by having the depth of the caudal peduncle equal to 14.1–27.0% of the length of the caudal peduncle. It differs from <i>E.</i> <i>dorsoarcus</i> by having the anal-fin origin closer to the caudal-fin base than to the pelvic-fin origin, and from <i>E.</i> <i>phongthoensis</i> by having the distance from the adipose-fin origin to the dorsal-fin insertion equal to about 50% of the adipose-fin base length. <i>Euchiloglanis</i> <i>davidi</i> and <i>E.</i> <i>kishinouyei</i> are redescribed from recently collected specimens from their type localities. A lectotype is designated for <i>E.</i> <i>davidi</i> and a neotype designated for <i>E.</i> <i>kishinouyei.</i> <i>Euchiloglanis</i> <i>kishinouyei</i> is distinguished from <i>E.</i> <i>davidi</i> by lacking an indentation in the premaxillary tooth band, by having the length of the pectoral fin equal to 75.5–89.6% of the distance between the insertions of the pectoral and pelvic fins, and by having the distance between the insertion of the pelvic-fin and the anus equal to 81.5–97.5% of the distance between the insertions of the pectoral and pelvic fins. A key to the species of is <i>Euchiloglanis</i> also provided.</p>

<h3><i>Campinasuchus dinizi </i>gen. et sp. nov., a new Late Cretaceous baurusuchid (Crocodyliformes) from the Bauru Basin, Brazil</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A remarkably diverse terrestrial mesoeucrocodylian fauna has been recovered from the continental Cretaceous of the Bauru Basin in fluvial and lacustrine deposits. Members of at least six distinct groups are now recognized, including notosuchids, sphagesaurids, candidodontids, peirosaurids, trematochampsids, and baurusuchids. These mostly terrestrial crocodyliforms potentially developed ecological strategies that allowed them to live in a hot and arid climate during the Cretaceous. A new genus and species of Baurusuchidae, <i>Campinasuchus</i> <i>dinizi</i> <b>gen.</b> <b>et</b> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> is established on the basis of several partial skulls and skeletons from the Turonian-Santonian Adamantina Formation. This taxon is notable for its relatively short, anteriorly tapering snout, marked maxillary heterodonty with third maxillary and fourth dentary teeth extremely enlarged relative to other teeth, and the presence of a large anteroposterior depression on each palatine between the palatal fenestrae. The presence of yet another crocodyliform from the Adamantina Formation reinforces the idea that aridity, or maybe a seasonally warm and dry climate alternating with periods of higher rainfall, drove the diversification of terrestrial crocodyliforms throughout the Late Cretaceous.</p>

<h3>New records of Serpulidae (Annelida, Polychaeta) collected by R/V "<i>Vityaz</i>" from bathyal and abyssal depths of the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<i>Elena K. Kupriyanova</i>, <i>Julie Bailey-Brock</i>, <i>Eijiroh Nishi</i><h4>Pages: 43-60</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The diversity of bathyal and abyssal marine organisms is still poorly known and this is especially true for tubicolous polychaetes of the family Serpulidae, the common inhabitants of subtidal and shelf locations. We report herein new records of poorly known deep-sea (mostly below 2000 m) serpulids collected in the Pacific Ocean by early Soviet Oceanographic expeditions onboard R/V “Vityaz”. The following species were found: <i>Bathyditrupa</i> <i>hovei,</i> <i>Bathyvermilia</i> <i>challengeri,</i> <i>B</i> <i>eliasoni,</i> <i>B.</i> <i>zibrowiusi,</i> <i>Filogranula</i> <i>stellata,</i> <i>Hyalopomatus</i> <i>jirkovi,</i> and <i>H.</i> <i>sikorski</i> at the depths of 1600–6330 m. Many samples collected by R/V “Vityaz” and other Russian research vessels are still unstudied and apparently many bathyal and abyssal serpulid species new to science remain undescribed. The diversity of abyssal marine organisms remains poorly known not only because of the obvious logistical difficulties in collecting at abyssal localities, but also in part due to the lack of taxonomic effort directed towards existing research collections.</p>
