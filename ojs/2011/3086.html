<h3>Relationships of South American marsupials (Didelphimorphia, Microbiotheria and Paucituberculata) and hard ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) with distribution of four species of <i>Ixodes</i></h3>
<i>Alberto A. Guglielmone</i>, <i>Santiago Nava</i>, <i>M. Mónica Díaz</i><h4>Pages: 1-30</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Historical information shows that South American marsupials are irrelevant hosts for South American hard ticks (Ixodidae Murray) of the genera <i>Haemaphysalis</i> Koch, <i>Rhipicephalus</i> Koch and <i>Dermacentor</i> Koch. Twenty two <i>Amblyomma</i> Koch species were occasionally found on Didelphimorphia Gill, but some records are doubtful (i.e., <i>A.</i> <i>dissimile</i> Koch, 1844) and only <i>A.</i> <i>fuscum</i> Neumann, 1907 appears to be a relevant parasite of this type of host. Twelve species of <i>Ixodes</i> Latreille were determined on these hosts, although one of them, <i>I.</i> <i>longiscutatus</i> Boero, 1944, is probably misidentified. Four species, <i>I.</i> <i>amarali</i> Fonseca, 1935b, <i>I.</i> <i>loricatus</i> Neumann, 1899, <i>I.</i> <i>luciae</i> Sénevet, 1940 and <i>I.</i> <i>venezuelensis</i> Kohls, 1953 are usual parasites of Didelphimorphia. These species (I. <i>venezuelensis</i> excluded) have adult ticks feeding mostly on Didelphidae Gray, and sub-adult ticks feeding mostly on Didelphidae and several species of sigmodontine rodents. All parasitic stages of <i>I.</i> <i>venezuelensis</i> were recorded from Didelphimorphia although rodents are also of importance for its life cycle. Records from marsupials and nonmarsupial hosts show that <i>I.</i> <i>amarali</i> is established in eastern Brazil, and <i>I.</i> <i>venezuelensis</i> in Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica. The alleged southernmost record of <i>I.</i> <i>luciae</i> in Central Argentina was found to be erroneous and its southern limit is located in northwestern Argentina and its way northwards includes Bolivia, Peru, western Brazil, French Guiana, Surinam, Trinidad & Tobago, Panama, Guatemala, Belize and southern Mexico with unconfirmed but probably valid records for Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Honduras. The distribution of <i>I.</i> <i>loricatus</i> has been historically considered to range from southern Argentina to southern Mexico but southernmost and northernmost records are now considered doubtful along with Venezuelan populations for this tick, while the only records for Panama and Colombia were based on wrong tick identifications. <i>Bona</i> <i>fide</i> populations of <i>I.</i> <i>loricatus</i> range from central-eastern Argentina and southern Uruguay to Paraguay up to north-eastern Brazil. <i>Dromiciops</i> <i>gliroides</i> Thomas, the only member of Microbiotheria Ameghino is the exclusive host of <i>Ixodes</i> <i>neuquenensis</i> Ringuelet, 1947. There is only one record of tick infestation (Ixodes <i>jonesae</i> Kohls, Sonenshine & Clifford, 1969) of Paucituberculata Ameghino, indicating that these marsupials are of no apparent importance for maintenance of South American hard ticks. We speculate that the species of <i>Ixodes</i> feeding on Didelphimorphia and Sigmodontinae Wagner are a clade derived from ancestors feeding exclusively on Didelphidae that radiated after the invasion of South America by Sigmodontinae or their ancestors. <i>Ixodes</i> <i>neuquenensis</i> (established in south-western South America) is considered a relatively new species that radiated from <i>Ixodes</i> parasites of Sigmodontinae invaders in southern South America.</p>

<h3>Phytoseiidae (Acari) in forest fragments in the State of São Paulo, Brazil</h3>
<i>Peterson R. Demite</i>, <i>Antonio C. Lofego</i>, <i>Reinaldo J. F. Feres</i><h4>Pages: 31-56</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Mites of the family Phytoseiidae have been extensively studied as biological control agents of various pests. However, knowledge of these mites in plants of forest fragments in Brazil is still incomplete. The aim of this study was to study the occurrence of Phytoseiidae in forest fragments in the Northwestern of State of São Paulo. Samplings were collected from 18 forest fragments, including 102 plant species belonging to 47 plant families. We recorded 46 phytoseiid species belonging to 17 genera and three subfamilies. Two new species are described, <i>Amblyseius</i> <i>biotafapesp</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> and <i>Amblyseius</i> <i>novagranadensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> <i>Trichilia</i> <i>casaretti</i> and <i>Actinostemon</i> <i>communis</i> harbored the largest numbers of species, 29 and 22, respectively. Some species recorded in this study have been frequently reported on cultivated plants. Besides the biological importance of knowing the phytoseiid mite fauna in these forests, survey studies can provide information to support projects on integrated pest management.</p>

<h3>A new species of <i>Chaceon </i>Manning & Holthuis, 1989, from the southwestern Atlantic, with a key to the western Atlantic species (Crustacea, Decapoda, Geryonidae)</h3>
<i>Marcos Tavares</i>, <i>Allysson P. Pinheiro</i><h4>Pages: 57-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new species of the deep-water crab genus <i>Chaceon</i> Manning & Holthuis, 1989 (Geryonidae Colosi, 1923), is described from southwestern Atlantic. It is the ninth species of the genus known from the western Atlantic. It is most closely related to <i>C.</i> <i>eldorado</i> Manning & Holthuis, 1989, <i>C.</i> <i>notialis</i> Manning & Holthuis, 1989, and <i>C.</i> <i>ramosae</i> Manning, Tavares & Albuquerque, 1989, from which it can be readily differentiated in having the dactyli of P2-P5 laterally compressed, instead of being dorsoventrally depressed. A key to the western Atlantic species of <i>Chaceon</i> is provided.</p>
