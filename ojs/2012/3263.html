<h3>Mediterranean fish biodiversity: an updated inventory with focus on the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas </h3>
<i>Peter Nick Psomadakis</i>, <i>Stefano Giustino</i>, <i>Marino Vacchi</i><h4>Pages: 1-46</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] In this paper we update the Mediterranean fish inventory, analyse the biogeographic features of this fauna and provideexhaustive biodiversity data for the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas. According to the data available in 2010, the Mediterraneanfish diversity can be summarized as follows: 602 (including sub-species) bony fish species (Osteichthyes), 79 cartilaginous fishspecies (Chondrichthyes) and 3 cyclostomes (Agnatha); making a total of 684 species belonging to 173 families (147Osteichthyes, 24 Chondrichthyes, 2 Agnatha). Most species 403 (58.9%) have an Atlantic origin, 128 (18.7%) species arecosmopolitan, 90 (13.2%) species are Indo-Pacific, and 63 (9.2%) are endemic to the Mediterranean. In the Ligurian Sea,northern Tyrrhenian and southern Tyrrhenian Sea, the richness can be estimated at 454, 426 and 447 species, respectively. Themost speciose families for the Mediterranean as a whole, but also for the three intra-mediterranean areas studied are theGobiidae, Sparidae, Labridae and Blenniidae; whereas Carangidae is a numerically important family mainly at theMediterranean level. The percentage of endemic fishes within the intra-mediterranean areas studied gradually decrease acrosslatitude from the Ligurian Sea (9.4%) to the northern (8.7%) and southern (8.0%) Tyrrhenian Sea. The updated fish inventorycontains 81 Lessepsian and 48 Atlantic immigrant species, which represent 11.8% and 7.0% of the whole Mediterranean fishcommunity, respectively. The Ligurian Sea (3.1%) houses a higher amount of immigrants with respect to the northern (1.6%)and southern (2.7%) Tyrrhenian sectors.Field observations made during this study indicate that both the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian seas are presently subjected toincreasing colonization events by thermophilic species spreading from the southern Mediterranean and to a lesser degree by the arrival of exotic species either of Atlantic or Indo-Pacific origin.</p>

<h3>The genus <i>Syllis </i>(Polychaeta: Syllidae: Syllinae) in the southern Mexican Pacific, with the description of two new species and three new records </h3>
<i>Diana L. Salcedo Oropeza</i>, <i>Guillermo San Martín</i>, <i>Vivianne Solís-Weiss</i><h4>Pages: 47-62</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] As part of a study dealing with polychaetes (Annelida: Polychaeta) from soft bottoms of the western coasts of AcapulcoBay, southern Mexican Pacific, 574 specimens of the genus <i>Syllis</i> Lamarck, 1818 were analyzed. Nine species are report-ed, of which <i>Syllis</i> <i>garciai</i> (Campoy, 1982) and <i>Syllis</i> <i>glarearia</i> (Westheide, 1974) are new records for the Mexican Pa-cific. <i>Syllis</i> <i>magnipectinis</i> (Storch, 1967), described from the Red Sea, is newly reported in the eastern Pacific; notes onits morphological variations and its distribution range are herein included. Additionally, two new species of <i>Syllis</i> are de-scribed: <i>S.</i> <i>antoniae</i> n. sp., is closely related to <i>S.</i> <i>vivipara</i> Krohn, 1869, but it has bidentate falcigers with a smaller sub-distal tooth and some falcigers with coarse spines on the edge. <i>S.</i> <i>deleoni</i> n. sp., is characterized by having bidentate falcigers with broad teeth and coarse spines and the body densely covered with papillae.</p>

<h3>Swedish Plectida (Nematoda). Part 1. <i>Domorganus suecicus </i>sp. n. from Skagerrak </h3>
<i>Oleksandr Holovachov</i><h4>Pages: 63-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new species of <i>Domorganus,</i> <i>D.</i> <i>suecicus</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>n.,</b> is described from bottom sediments collected in Skagerrak off the westcoast of Sweden. It is characterised by its long body (1.3–1.6 mm), lateral field originating immediately posterior toamphid, excretory pore located at the level of basal pharyngeal bulb, absence of advulval sensilla, straight spicules andabsence of gubernaculum. The new species has a unique set of characters (position of excretory pore and absence of thegubernaculum) separating it from all other known species of the genus. It shows some resemblance to the previouslydescribed species <i>D.</i> <i>acutus</i> and <i>D.</i> <i>subtilis</i> in body size and most measurements, but can be easily separated from both bythe relatively longer tail, shorter spicules, position of the anterior end of the lateral field near amphid, position of theexcretory pore anterior to pharyngo-intestinal junction, and absence of gubernaculum. A tabular compendium of species of the genus <i>Domorganus</i> is also given.</p>
