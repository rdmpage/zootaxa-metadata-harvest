<h3>A review of the hyperiidean amphipod families Mimonectidae and Proscinidae (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Hyperiidea: Scinoidea)</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A taxonomic review of the hyperiidean amphipod families Mimonectidae and Proscinidae, superfamily Sciniodea, is pre-sented, based predominantly on collections held by the Zoological Museum, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Priorto this review the family Mimonectidae consisted of two genera, <i>Mimonectes</i> with five species and <i>Pseudomimonectes</i>with one species, and the family Proscinidae consisted of three genera, <i>Proscina</i> with five species, <i>Mimoscina</i> with twospecies and <i>Cheloscina</i> with one species. The five nominal species of <i>Mimonectes</i> are also recognised in this review withthe addition of three new species, <i>M.</i> <i>alexanderi</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> <i>M.</i> <i>colemani</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> and <i>M.</i> <i>neosphaericus</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> No morespecimens of <i>Pseudomimonectes</i> were found, and this genus is still known only from the unique type. A critical review ofthe family Proscinidae is presented arguing that its taxonomic distinction from the family Mimonectidae cannot be main-tained. Amongst the genus <i>Proscina,</i> <i>P.</i> <i>scinoides</i> (Woltereck, 1906) is considered a species of <i>Mimoscina</i> and <i>P.</i> <i>magna</i>Stephensen and Pirlot, 1931 a junior synonym of <i>Mimonectes</i> <i>loveni</i> Bovallius, 1885. The remaining three species are con-sidered valid for the time being and are transferred to the genus <i>Mimonectes.</i> Thus, eleven species of <i>Mimonectes</i> are rec-ognised in this review. <i>Cheloscina,</i> still known only from the unique type, is also similar to <i>Mimonectes,</i> apart from themorphology of the first antennae, and is here included in the family Mimonectidae. <i>Mimoscina</i> however possesses severalcharacters distinguishing it from other members of the Mimonectidae and a new family, Mimoscinidae <b>fam.</b> <b>nov.</b> is pro-posed to accommodate it. The two nominal species of <i>Mimoscina</i> are also recognised in this review with the addition ofone new species, <i>M.</i> <i>galbraithae</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> Amongst the extensive <i>Dana</i> collections is one specimen that clearly belongswith the Scinoidea but possesses several unique characters that preclude it from all other currently recognised families.Thus, a new family, Microscinidae <b>fam.</b> <b>nov.</b> is proposed to accommodate this new genus and species, <i>Microscina</i> <i>rostrata</i><b>gen.</b> et <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> Keys are provided for all families, genera and species, together with diagnoses, and all species are illustrated.</p>
