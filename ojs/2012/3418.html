<h3>Faunal survey and identification key for the trematodes (Platyhelminthes: Digenea) infecting <i>Potamopyrgus antipodarum </i>(Gastropoda: Hydrobiidae) as first intermediate host</h3>
<i>Ryan F. Hechinger</i><h4>Pages: 1-27</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A diverse guild of digenean trematodes infects the New Zealand mud snail, <i>Potamopyrgus</i> <i>antipodarum,</i> as firstintermediate host. This manuscript offers an initial systematic treatment of these trematodes and relies on published andnew information. I list 20 trematode species, for which I provide taxonomic affinities, life-cycle information, and anidentification key. A species account section presents photographs, diagnostic information, additional descriptive notes,and information on relevant research concerning the listed species. The major aim of this manuscript is to facilitateresearch on this trematode guild by providing information and identification tools, and by highlighting gaps in our knowledge.</p>

<h3>Squat lobsters (Crustacea: Decapoda: Galatheoidea and Chirostyloidea) collected during the TALUD XIV cruise in the Gulf of California, Mexico, and rediscovery of <i>Gastroptychus perarmatus </i>(Haig, 1968) in the eastern Pacific</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Seven species of squat lobsters were collected during the TALUD XIV cruise in the Gulf of California, Mexico. <i>Gastrop-</i><i>tychus</i> <i>perarmatus</i> (Haig, 1968) was collected for the second time since it was described and represents a first record ofthe genus in the tropical eastern Pacific. Its association with gorgonians is also noted from color pictures taken during adeep-water dive in another cruise in the area. <i>Janetogalathea</i> <i>californiensis</i> (Benedict, 1902) was captured in four sam-pling stations, in the same area where it has been previously reported. Three species of <i>Munida</i> Leach, 1820 were collected(M. <i>bapensis</i> Hendrickx, 2000, <i>M.</i> <i>mexicana</i> Benedict, 1902, and <i>M.</i> <i>tenella</i> Benedict, 1902). Records of <i>M.</i> <i>bapensis</i> ofthis cruise combined with additional captures of this species in 2007 in the same area indicate that it is the most abundantdeep-water species of squat lobster in the northern part of the central Gulf of California. Among the species of <i>Munida,</i><i>M.</i> <i>tenella</i> was second in abundance and included specimens much larger than previously known. The single record for<i>M.</i> <i>mexicana</i> fits within the currently known depth and geographical ranges. Only one species of <i>Munidopsis</i> Whiteaves,1874 (M. <i>depressa</i> Faxon, 1892) was collected, in one of the deeper sampling stations visited during the cruise and itsnorthernmost distribution limit within the Gulf of California is increased by ca two degrees of latitude. The seventh speciescollected during this survey, <i>Pleuroncodes</i> <i>planipes</i> Stimpson, 1860, is a common inhabitant of the California Current and the Gulf of California.</p>

<h3>The class Diplopoda in Mongolia, with description of a new species</h3>
<i>Elena V. Mikhaljova</i><h4>Pages: 41-50</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The class Diplopoda appears to be represented in Mongolia by eight species from 4 genera, 2 families (Polyzoniidae andDiplomaragnidae) and 2 orders (Polyzoniida and Chordeumatida). One species is described here as new to science: <i>Shear-</i><i>ia</i> <i>longa</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> Genus <i>Shearia</i> Mikhaljova, 2000 is new to the fauna of Mongolia. All currently known Diplopoda taxa from Mongolia are keyed, including the new species. The distributions of all Mongolian diplopod species are mapped.</p>

<h3><i>Paracaesio brevidentata </i>n. sp., a new snapper (Lutjanidae: Apsilinae) from Indonesia</h3>
<i>William T. White</i>, <i>Peter R. Last</i><h4>Pages: 51-60</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] <i>Paracaesio</i> <i>brevidentata,</i> a new species of apsiline lutjanid fish from southeastern Indonesia, is described, bringing thetotal number of known species in this deepwater snapper genus to nine. The new species is distinguished from its conge-ners by the following combination of characters: very small teeth in jaws without enlarged canines, tubular lateral-linescales 71–73, pectoral-fin rays 18 or 19, caudal fin deeply forked, penultimate rays of soft dorsal and anal fins not longerthan adjacent rays, snout short, maxilla scaly and body purplish brown and caudal fin reddish with upper and lower lobessimilar in colour. Members of the genus are distinguished in a key. A specimen of <i>Paracaesio</i> <i>caerulea</i> from southeastern Indonesia represents the first record of this species from Indonesian waters.</p>

<h3>A new species of the gobiid genus <i>Eviota </i>(Teleostei: Gobioidei) from the Kermadec Islands, New Zealand</h3>
<i>Douglass F. Hoese</i>, <i>Andrew L. Stewart</i><h4>Pages: 61-67</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] <i>Eviota</i> <i>kermadecensis</i> is described as a new species from the Kermadec Islands, mainly from Raoul Island, and is the onlyspecies of <i>Eviota</i> known from the Kermadec Islands. It is most similar to <i>E.</i> <i>abax</i> and <i>E.</i> <i>masudai</i> from Japan in morphol-ogy and fin-ray counts. All three species normally have I,10 second dorsal fin-ray counts. <i>Eviota</i> <i>kermadecensis</i> differs largely in coloration. The species has a ratio of 1.5 females to males and males average a larger size.</p>
