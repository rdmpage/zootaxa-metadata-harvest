<h3>Morphological diversity and phylogenetic relationships within a South-American clade of iguanian lizards (Liolaemidae: <i>Phymaturus</i>)</h3>
<i>Fernando Lobo</i>, <i>Cristian Abdala</i>, <i>Soledad Valdecantos</i><h4>Pages: 1-41</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] With 36 species and at least nine potentially independent lineages (not formally described yet) occurring mostly in theAndes and adjacent Patagonia and Puna plateau areas, <i>Phymaturus</i> lizards represent one of the most endemic vertebrategroups of the arid southwestern region of South America. Phylogenetic relationships among species of <i>Phymaturus</i> areinferred using mainly a morphological data set of 206 characters. Also available sequences of mitochondrial DNA for sev-en terminals were added for a total evidence analysis. Most information is included in the discrete characters block; mostcharacters involve color pattern, osteology and squamation. Continuous characters were taken from body proportions,squamation and skeletons. Among morphological data, binary polymorphic characters were analyzed applying the scaledcoding criteria. Continuous characters were entered in the analysis using standardized ranges, a method that allows a sim-ple optimization to estimate distances/costs avoiding the arbitrary coding as discrete characters. For our parsimony anal-yses we chose the implied weights method, which underweights homoplastic characters. Several runs were madeanalyzing all the information combined and also separating morphological from molecular datasets. Binary polymor-phisms were also analyzed as missing data. All characters affected by sexual dimorphism were analyzed separating thesexes; female information was more congruent with the total evidence analysis. Characters involving continuous and poly-morphic information are relevant for searching and building phylogenetic hypotheses in <i>Phymaturus.</i> There exists signif-icant congruence between the molecular information analyzed in this study and previous published analyses. Within bothmain clades of <i>Phymaturus,</i> northern subgroups are those more recently originated during the genus diversification. Spe-cies belonging to the puna subclade of the <i>palluma</i> group are arranged in two natural groups, one distributed in the north(Catamarca and La Rioja provinces), and the other in the south, La Rioja and San Juan provinces. Within the <i>patagonicus</i>group, the majority of the species are arranged in a south-central Chubut clade, eastern-central Chubut clade, central Rio Negro clade and a Payunia clade.</p>

<h3>Description of four new species of <i>Limnadopsis </i>from Australia (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Spinicaudata)</h3>
<i>Martin Schwentner</i>, <i>Brian V. Timms</i>, <i>Stefan Richter</i><h4>Pages: 42-64</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Four new species of <i>Limnadopsis,</i> <i>L.</i> <i>bloodwoodensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> <i>L.</i> <i>paratatei</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> <i>L.</i> <i>brevirostris</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> and <i>L.</i> <i>centralensis</i><b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> are described for Australia. Three of these were delineated in an earlier study based on an integrative taxonomicapproach. The fourth (L. <i>centralensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.)</b> was not part of that study but can be distinguished from all other <i>Limnadopsis</i>morphologically. The morphological variation in <i>L.</i> <i>tatei</i> is described here in detail as <i>L.</i> <i>paratatei</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> and <i>L.</i> <i>tatei</i> closely resemble each other and have in earlier studies been grouped together as <i>L.</i> <i>tatei.</i></p>
