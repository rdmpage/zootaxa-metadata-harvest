<i>Daniel Golani</i>, <i>Sergey V. Bogorodsky</i><h4>Pages: 1-135</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new and updated checklist of the fishes of the Red Sea is presented. A total of 1078 species belonging to154 families, 25 orders and two classes are listed. The number of species is considerably lower than that given in the last checklist (CLOFRES II, Goren and Dor, 1994) which included all records, "quotations" and distribution maps without distinguishing between substantiated and unsubstantiated records. In addition, an annotated list is provided for all those species that were recorded unjustifiably and were included in CLOFRES II and in subsequent publications.</p>
