<h3>Revision of the genus <i>Renda </i>Blackwelder, 1952 (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae: Xantholinini)</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The genus <i>Renda</i> Blackwelder, 1952 is revised and redescribed. Thirteen previously described species of <i>Renda</i> are redescribed and twenty-one species are described as new. <i>Renda</i> <i>funebris</i> (Sharp, 1876) is proposed as a junior synonym of <i>R.</i> <i>flagellicornis</i> (Nordmann, 1837), <i>R.</i> <i>pubescens</i> (Nordmann, 1837) as a junior synonym of <i>R.</i> <i>formicaria</i> (Laporte, 1835), and <i>R.</i> <i>dalmasi</i> (Fauvel, 1901) as a junior synonym of <i>R.</i> <i>minor</i> Sharp, 1876. A key to the species of <i>Renda</i> is provided and diagnostic characters are illustrated. A generic key for a group of genera consisting of <i>Renda,</i> <i>Agrodes</i> and <i>Plochionocerus</i> is also included. A phylogenetic analysis was performed to analyze the relationships among <i>Renda</i> species, based on the study of 416 specimens belonging to 31 species. The strict consensus tree supports the monophyly of the genus, but species relationships within <i>Renda</i> are poorly resolved, with only two species groups recovered as monophyletic clades.</p>
