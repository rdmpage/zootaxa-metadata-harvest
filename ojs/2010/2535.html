<h3>Catalog of the types of some families of Coleoptera (Insecta) deposited at Coleção de Entomologia Pe. J. S. Moure, Curitiba, Brazil</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The Coleoptera type species of Coleção de Entomologia Pe. J. S. Moure, housed in the Zoology Department, Curitiba, Brazil, were examined and listed. This is an important collection in South America and the third largest in Brazil. The type materials of two series of Polyphaga were treated; in Staphyliniformia, the families Leiodidae and Staphylinidae and in Cucujiformia, Coccinellidae and Chrysomelidae. Complete information is given for each type, including the reference of the original description and labels data. A total of 112 types were listed, increasing the number of types, compared to the previous list (Marinoni <i>et</i> <i>al.</i> 1992).</p>

<h3>The taxonomic impediment of unrecognised flight polymorphism in Notonectidae (Hemiptera:Heteroptera)</h3>
<i>Euan C. Young</i><h4>Pages: 35-48</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Foundation revisions of four genera within the Notonectidae (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Nepomorpha) were reviewed to determine how the existence of previously unrecognised polymorphism of the wings or flight musculature might have led to confusion in the description of species. Specimens of the flightless morph may appear very different from flight capable ones. They are generally less pigmented and may be both smaller and less robust. In species descriptions the flightless morph can usually be readily diagnosed through the reduced pigmentation of the mesoscutellum. Flight-muscle and wing polymorphisms were found to be common in these genera. In <i>Notonecta</i> only one of the possible flying or flightless morphs was described in 51 of 60 species (85%), in <i>Anisops</i> in 64 of 80 species (80%), in <i>Buenoa</i> 26 of 35 species (74%), and in <i>Enithares</i> 11 of 33 species (33%). A greater recognition of the existence of flight polymorphism in this family can lead to more robust species descriptions and selection of type specimens. Within the four genera considered here alternative morphs are yet to be described in many species.</p>

<h3>New species of <i>Anastrepha </i>Schiner (Diptera, Tephritidae) from remnant area of the Atlantic Rain Forest and surroundings in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil</h3>
<i>Keiko Uramoto</i>, <i>Roberto Antonio Zucchi</i><h4>Pages: 49-60</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Four new species of <i>Anastrepha</i> Schiner were collected in McPhail-type traps hung in trees in a natural reserve and in commercial papaya orchards in Linhares, Espírito Santo state, Brazil. They are described and named herein as follows: <i>Anastrepha</i> <i>atlantica</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.,</b> <i>Anastrepha</i> <i>glochin</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.,</b> <i>Anastrepha</i> <i>linharensis</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> and <i>Anastrepha</i> <i>martinsi</i> <b>n.</b> <b>sp.</b> Only the latter was collected in traps hung in papaya orchards. The classification of these species in species groups of <i>Anastrepha</i> is also discussed.</p>

<h3>A new mayfly species of <i>Caenis </i>from headwater of Zijin Hill (Nanjing, Eastern China) (Ephemeroptera: Caenidae)</h3>
<i>Yan-Yan Jia</i>, <i>Jia-Zhang Qin</i>, <i>Min Ju</i>, <i>Chang-Fa Zhou</i><h4>Pages: 61-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] In the headwaters of several small streams of Zijin hill (Nanjing City) we found a new species of the genus <i>Caenis.</i> Herein this species is illustrated and described as <i>Caenis</i> <i>pycnacantha</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> Its main diagnostic characters include: in nymphs, it has “normal” body shape, each femur has a dark brown subapical marking, and the maxillary palpi have relatively long apical segments. In adults, the forceps have dense setae on the surface and four large spines at the apex and the antennae have a slightly expanded base of the flagellum.</p>
