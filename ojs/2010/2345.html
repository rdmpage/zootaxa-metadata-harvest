<h3>A taxonomic revision of <i>Pseudosida szalayi </i>Daday, 1898 (Crustacea: Cladocera: Sididae) over its Asian range, with focus on the northernmost populations first recorded from the Amur River basin (Far East of Russia)</h3>
<i>Nikolai M. Korovchinsky</i><h4>Pages: 1-18</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] <i>Pseudosida</i> <i>szalayi</i> Daday, 1898 is redescribed on the basis on type material from Sri Lanka (Ceylon) and other materials from India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, East and South China, and Far East of Russia (Lower Amur River basin). The investigation of intraand interpopulational morphological variability has allowed coming to the conclusion about the conspecificity of specimens from different regions and occurrence of the only species, <i>P.</i> <i>szalayi,</i> in East and South Asia. The male of the species is described in detail for the first time. The first discovered northernmost localities of the species in the Lower Amur River basin are far separated from others and may have a relict status. While probably, only one species of the genus occurs in East and South Asia, the taxonomic status of African pseudosidas known under the names “P. <i>szalayi”</i> and “P. <i>bidentata”</i> remains uncertain.</p>

<h3><i>Ancistrus falconensis </i>n. sp. and <i>A. gymnorhynchus </i>Kner (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) from central Venezuelan Caribbean coastal streams</h3>
<i>Donald C. Taphorn</i>, <i>Jonathan W. Armbruster</i>, <i>Douglas Rodríguezolarte</i><h4>Pages: 19-32</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new species, <i>Ancistrus</i> <i>falconensis,</i> is described from the Hueque and Ricoa Rivers, small, isolated Caribbean drainages of northwest Falcón state, (Western Caribbean Zoogeographic Province) Venezuela and compared with <i>A.</i> <i>gymnorhynchus</i> Kner 1854 which occurs in adjacent drainages to the south. Adults of <i>Ancistrus</i> <i>falconensis</i> usually have small light spots on the abdomen in preserved specimens whereas <i>A.</i> <i>gymnorhynchus</i> almost always has the abdomen uniformly gray). They are further distinguished by the following ratios in specimens greater than 60 mm SL: mouth width/pectoral spine length (0.661–0.915 vs. 0.480–0.669, (two specimens of 88 overlap), dentary tooth cup length/ pectoral spine length (0.207–0.264 vs. 0.143–0.198), and premaxillary tooth cup length/pectoral spine length (0.146– 0.215 vs. 0.215–0.318). Falcón state is arid in the area of the type locality of <i>A.</i> <i>falconensis,</i> and water resources face increasing demands for urban, agricultural and industrial uses. Deforestation, river channelization and water diversion heavily impact most coastal streams, causing accelerating habitat loss and degradation. Thus, this new species must be considered vulnerable to extinction.</p>

<h3>Systematic reassessments of fanged frogs from China and adjacent regions (Anura: Dicroglossidae)</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Systematic relationships of fanged frogs usually associated with <i>Limnonectes</i> <i>kuhlii</i> are assessed using 15 samples from Japan, Chinese Mainland and Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia (Borneo), and Indonesia. Phylogenetic relationship inferred from the mitochondrial 12S rRNA, tRNA val , and 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that fanged frogs sampled are not monophyletic with the topotypic <i>L.</i> <i>kuhlii</i> from Java. Samples from Yunnan of southern China (L. <i>bannaensis),</i> northern Laos and central Vietnam, and those from Jiangxi of eastern China (L. <i>fujianensis),</i> Taiwan and Japan (L. <i>namiyei),</i> respectively, form monophyletic groups, and are collectively sister to the Thai sample (L. <i>megastomias).</i> All these samples, <i>L.</i> <i>fragilis</i> from Hainan of southern China, and a group of Bornean samples show unresolved relationships with Javanese <i>L.</i> <i>kuhlii.</i> From the resultant phylogeny and genetic distances found among samples, <i>L.</i> "kuhlii" from Taiwan and <i>L.</i> <i>fujianensis,</i> and <i>L.</i> "kuhlii" from northern Laos and central Vietnam and <i>L.</i> <i>bannaensis,</i> respectively, are surmised to be conspecific. These fanged frogs are morphologically similar to, but phylogenetically distant from, <i>L.</i> <i>kuhlii</i> sensu stricto. <i>Limnonectes</i> <i>namiyei,</i> <i>L.</i> <i>fujianensis,</i> and <i>L.</i> <i>bannaensis</i> are considered to have a common ancestor whose chromosome number was 2n=22, unlike <i>L.</i> <i>fragilis,</i> <i>L.</i> <i>kuhlii</i> and many other frogs with 2n=26 chromosomes.</p>

<h3>Taxonomy of the sand bubbler crabs <i>Scopimera globosa </i>De Haan, 1835, and <i>S. tuberculata </i>Stimpson, 1858 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Dotillidae) in East Asia, with description of a new species from the Ryukyus, Japan</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Sand bubbler crabs of the genus <i>Scopimera</i> are common on sandy shores in East Asia yet the taxonomy of the species remains unclear. <i>Scopimera</i> <i>globosa</i> De Haan, 1835, the type species, was described from Japanese specimens and also occurs in Korea and China. <i>Scopimera</i> <i>tuberculata</i> Stimpson, 1858, described from Japan, has been regarded a junior synonym of <i>S.</i> <i>globosa,</i> but the types had long been lost. Some workers have considered the two taxa distinct and <i>S.</i> <i>tuberculata</i> has been recorded from South China. In the present study, we confirm using male gonopod morphology and molecular analysis, that the early records of <i>S.</i> <i>tuberculata</i> from Hong Kong and <i>S.</i> <i>globosa</i> from Taiwan are in fact <i>S.</i> <i>intermedia</i> Balss, 1934. The present study regards <i>S.</i> <i>tuberculata</i> as a subjective junior synonym to <i>S.</i> <i>globosa.</i> A new species, <i>Scopimera</i> <i>ryukyuensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> from the Ryukyus, is identified and described herein. The new species is close to <i>S.</i> <i>globosa</i> but can be separated by carapace characters. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene revealed basepair (bp) difference between the new species and other <i>Scopimera</i> spp. to be at the interspecific level, at least 28 bp (4.3%).</p>

<h3>A new species of <i>Crocidura </i>(Soricomorpha: Soricidae) from southern Vietnam and north-eastern Cambodia</h3>
<i>Paulina D. Jenkins</i>, <i>Alexei V. Abramov</i>, <i>Viatcheslav V. Rozhnov</i>, <i>Annette Olsson</i><h4>Pages: 60-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Knowledge of the Soricidae occurring in Vietnam has recently expanded with the discovery of several species previously unknown to science. Here we describe a new species of white-toothed shrew belonging to the genus <i>Crocidura</i> from lowland areas in southern Vietnam and from a river valley in north-eastern Cambodia. This small to medium sized species is diagnosed on the basis of external features, cranial proportions and morphology of the last upper and lower molars. Comparisons are made with other species of <i>Crocidura</i> known to occur in Vietnam and the biogeography of the regions where the new species has been found, is briefly discussed.</p>
