<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] All eastern and southern African species of Typhlopidae (excluding <i>Letheobia)</i> are reviewed with synonymies, diagnoses, and distribution maps. The 27 species from this region are arranged as follows: three species remain in <i>Typhlops</i> (with <i>T.</i> <i>cuneirostris</i> <i>calabresii</i> elevated to full species status), 16 species are transferred from <i>Typhlops</i> to a new genus endemic to Africa (including a new species described from Kenya), three species remain in <i>Rhinotyphlops,</i> four species are transferred from <i>Rhinotyphlops</i> to a new genus endemic to Africa (with <i>R.</i> <i>schlegelii</i> <i>brevis</i> and <i>R.</i> <i>s.</i> <i>mucruso</i> elevated to full species status), and one invasive species of <i>Ramphotyphlops</i> is included, which has been established in a few areas. Keys to the included species and all six African typhlopid genera are provided. A current taxonomic synopsis is provided for extralimital African and Southwest Asian typhlopid species.</p>
