<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Taxonomic and nomenclatorial changes affecting Symphyta, resulting from work on a forthcoming world catalog, are proposed and explained. <i>Dolerus</i> <i>zhelochovtsevi</i> Heidemaa & Viitasaari, <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> is described. One former subgenus and two former subspecies are now treated at genus or species level, respectively. Eighteen replacement names are given, 73 new synonymies and 78 new combinations are proposed, 3 synonymies are re-established, and 5 names are resurrected from synonymy. The precedence of 18 species names (nomina protecta) over their older synonyms (20 nomina oblita) is explained. Type species are designated for 8 genus-group names. One neotype and 17 lectotypes are designated. Five names described as varieties are assigned infrasubspecific rank. Twenty-five genus-group names associated with <i>Arge,</i> <i>Corynis,</i> <i>Dolerus,</i> <i>Trichiosoma</i> and <i>Xyela</i> are unavailable. Two genus-group names and 33 species-group names are considered as unplaced taxa. An identification key is presented for the West Palaearctic species of <i>Profenusa</i> MacGillivray, 1914. Notes on publication dates and authorships of names of certain taxa are also included.</p>
