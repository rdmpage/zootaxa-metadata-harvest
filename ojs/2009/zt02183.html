<h3>Unresolved cases of type fixation, synonymy and homonymy in harpacticoid copepod nomenclature (Crustacea: Copepoda)</h3>
<i>Rony Huys</i><h4>Pages: 1-99</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Type fixation for each of the 601 valid genera (17 placed <i>incertae</i> <i>sedis)</i> and 13 genera of doubtful identity (genera <i>inquirenda)</i> in the Harpacticoida (Crustacea, Copepoda) has been verified. Twenty-four genus-group names published after 1930 lack the mandatory type fixation and are therefore unavailable. With the exception of <i>Kliopsyllus</i> Kunz, 1962 which is replaced by its senior synonym <i>Emertonia</i> Wilson, 1932, such names are made available here by either attributing the original name to the first author(s) who explicitly fixed a type species (Psammastacus Nicholls, 1935; <i>Alteuthellopsis</i> Lang, 1944; <i>Idyellopsis</i> Lang, 1944; <i>Paralaophonte</i> Lang, 1944; <i>Robertgurneya</i> Lang, 1944; <i>Cladorostrata</i> Shen & Tai, 1963; <i>Micropsammis</i> Mielke, 1975; and the subgenera <i>Rheocamptus</i> Borutzky, 1948 and <i>Scottopsyllus</i> Kunz, 1962;) or by adopting the name taking the present authorship and date (Paranannopus Lang, 1936a; <i>Paraidya</i> Sewell, 1940; <i>Apodopsyllus</i> Kunz, 1962; <i>Scottolana</i> Por, 1967; <i>Barbaracletodes</i> Becker, 1979; <i>Ameiropsyllus</i> Bodin, 1979; <i>Chilaophonte</i> Mielke, 1985; <i>Psammonitocrella</i> Rouch, 1992; <i>Tectacingulum</i> Harris, 1994; and the subgenera <i>Intermedopsyllus</i> Kunz, 1962 (corrected spelling <i>Intermediopsyllus)</i> and <i>Fiersiella</i> Suárez Morales & Iliffe, 2005). In two cases a ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature will be required to avoid upsetting a long-accepted name in its accustomed meaning (Halectinosoma Lang, 1944; <i>Heterolaophonte</i> Lang, 1944). The recently proposed generic name <i>Pilocamptus</i> Wells, 2007 does not satisfy the provisions of ICZN Art. 13.1 and is here made available by explicit citation of a bibliographic reference that provides a diagnosis purported to differentiate the taxon. <i>Rhizothrix</i> Brady & Robertson, 1876 is an unavailable name which was first made available by Sars (1909a). The unavailable generic name <i>Scottopsyllus</i> Kunz, 1962 has no potentially valid synonym and is replaced by the next oldest available name from among its subgenera, i.e. <i>Wellsopsyllus</i> Kunz, 1981 (ICZN Art. 23.3.5). The unavailable subgeneric name <i>Psyllocamptus</i> (Langpsyllocamptus) Kunz, 1975b is not reinstated because it denotes a taxon that is based exclusively on plesiomorphies. New replacement names have been proposed for preoccupied generic names in the harpacticoid families Canthocamptidae (Poria Lang, 1965; <i>Dahlakia</i> Por, 1986a), Dactylopusiidae (Sewellia Lang, 1965), and Leptopontiidae (Ichnusella Cottarelli, 1971). The preoccupied generic name <i>Anoplosoma</i> Sars, 1911c (family Ameiridae) is replaced by a previously proposed, but subsequently forgotten, replacement name, <i>Anoplosomella</i> Strand, 1929. <i>Nomina</i> <i>nova</i> are also suggested for <i>Parathalassius</i> Dussart, 1986 (Calanoida: Centropagidae) and <i>Berea</i> Yamaguti, 1963 (Cyclopoida: Chondracanthidae) which have entered into homonymy with previously established names. The junior synonym <i>Alteutha</i> Baird, 1846b is considered valid, taking precedence as a <i>nomen</i> <i>protectum</i> over the older names <i>Sterope</i> Goodsir, 1845 and <i>Carillus</i> Goodsir, 1845 (nomina <i>oblita).</i> Similar reversal of precedence applies to the family-group names Peltidiidae Claus, 1860 and Tisbidae Stebbing, 1910 which are junior subjective synonyms of Steropinae Dana, 1854 and Scutellidiinae Claus, 1889, respectively. Since the type of <i>Idomene</i> Philippi, 1843 is identified as a member of the Clausidiidae (Cyclopoida), the generic name <i>Xouthous</i> Thomson, 1883 is reinstated to accommodate all remaining species currently placed in <i>Idomene.</i> The forgotten copepod genus <i>Microchelonia</i> Brady, 1918 is placed in the family Laophontidae and considered a senior subjective synonym of <i>Namakosiramia</i> Ho & Perkins, 1977. The family-group name Pontostratiotidae A. Scott, 1909 (type: <i>Pontostratiotes</i> Brady, 1883) is a senior subjective synonym of Cerviniopseinae Brotskaya, 1963 (type: <i>Cerviniopsis</i> Sars, 1903) and the former is consequently reinstated at the subfamilial level. The family-group name Huntemanniidae Por, 1986a (type: <i>Huntemannia</i> Poppe, 1884) is a junior subjective synonym of Nannopinae Brady, 1880a (type: <i>Nannopus</i> Brady, 1880a) and the latter is reinstated as the valid name at family rank and with the spelling corrected to Nannopodidae. The family-name Paranannopinae Por, 1986a is a <i>nomen</i> <i>nudum</i> based on an unavailable generic name and is replaced by Danielsseniinae Huys & Gee in Huys <i>et</i> <i>al.,</i> 1996. Four orphaned taxonomic groupings created by the removal of the type species – but not of the remaining species included in a genus – require an existing (previously invalid) or new generic name. <i>Amphiascus</i> Sars, 1905a is a senior objective synonym of <i>Paramphiascopsis</i> Lang, 1944 and must be restricted to the species currently included in the latter; a new genus <i>Sarsamphiascus</i> (type: <i>Dactylopus</i> <i>minutus</i> Claus, 1863) is proposed to receive all remaining <i>Amphiascus</i> species. The new generic names <i>Monardius</i> gen. nov. and <i>Glabrotelson</i> gen. nov. are proposed for the orphaned taxonomic groupings resulting from the removal of the types of <i>Teissierella</i> Monard, 1935a to <i>Robertsonia</i> Brady, 1880a, and of <i>Hastigerella</i> Nicholls, 1935 to <i>Arenosetella</i> Wilson, 1932, respectively. <i>Leptomesochra</i> Sars, 1911b is a senior subjective synonym of <i>Interleptomesochra</i> Lang, 1965 and must be restricted to the latter’s taxonomic concept; the previously unavailable generic name <i>Leptameira</i> Lang, 1936d is reinstated under the present authorship and date to assemble all remaining <i>Leptomesochra</i> species.</p>
