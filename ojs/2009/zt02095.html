<h3><i>Etheostoma erythrozonum</i>, a new species of darter (Teleostei: Percidae) from the Meramec River drainage, Missouri</h3>
<i>John F. Switzer</i>, <i>Robert M. Wood</i><h4>Pages: 1-7</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new species of darter, <i>Etheostoma</i> <i>erythrozonum,</i> is described from the Meramec River drainage of Missouri, USA. <i>Etheostoma</i> <i>erythrozonum</i> is the first known fish species endemic to the Meramec River drainage. It differs morphologically and genetically from populations of its sister species, <i>Etheostoma</i> <i>tetrazonum,</i> from the Gasconade River, Osage River, and Moreau River drainages.</p>

<h3>New species of <i>Ptychozoon </i>(Sauria: Gekkonidae) from the Nicobar Archipelago, Indian Ocean</h3>
<i>Indraneil Das</i>, <i>S. P. Vijayakumar</i><h4>Pages: 8-20</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new species of <i>Ptychozoon</i> is described from the central portion of the Nicobar Archipelago, Bay of Bengal, India. It has been formerly referred to <i>P.</i> <i>kuhli,</i> a species widely distributed in Sundaland. <i>Ptychozoon</i> <i>nicobarensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> reaches an SVL of 100.3 mm, and is diagnosable from congeneric species in showing the following combination of characters: dorsum with a tan vertebral stripe, lacking dark transverse bars; supranasals in contact; cutaneous expansions on sides of head; absence of predigital notch in preantebrachial cutaneous expansion; imbricate parachute support scales; four irregular rows of low, rounded enlarged scales on dorsum; 20–29 scales across widest portion of tail terminus; three indistinct chevrons on dorsum; 7–11 pairs of preanal pores; femoral pores absent; tail with an expanded terminal flap and weak lobe fusion at proximal border of tail terminus. The curious distribution of the new species, centred around the central Nicobars is speculated to be the result of competition with and/or predation by large gekkonid species, to the north (Gekko <i>verreauxi)</i> and south (G. <i>smithii)</i> of the group of islands occupied by the new <i>Ptychozoon</i> from the central Nicobars.</p>

<h3>Tardigrades from northwestern Patagonia (Neuquén Province, Argentina) with the description of three new species</h3>
<i>Gustavo Rossi</i>, <i>Maria Claps</i>, <i>Diego Ardohain</i><h4>Pages: 21-36</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Fifteen moss and lichen samples collected in localities of the Neuquén province, Argentina, contained tardigrades and their eggs. Eighteen species were found, three being new to science: <i>Macrobiotus</i> <i>neuquensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> <i>Macrobiotus</i> <i>tehuelchensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> and <i>Minibiotus</i> <i>claxtonae</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> <i>Macrobiotus</i> <i>neuquensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> can be differentiated from the other species of the <i>harmsworthi</i> group by the presence of a cuticular bar and a refractile zone in the first three pairs of legs. Also the characteristics of the eggs such as the shape and distribution of processes allow a distinction from other species. <i>Macrobiotus</i> <i>tehuelchensis</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> differs from other similar species by the measurements of some structures of the buccal apparatus and the characteristics of the eggs (the shape of the processes). <i>Minibiotus</i> <i>claxtonae</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> is characterized by the presence of three macroplacoids, a microplacoid, and cuticular pores arranged in transverse bands. The new species of <i>Minibiotus</i> is distinguished from other species of the genus by the distribution and shape of the pores (round and star shaped), presence of granulation on the legs, and some characteristics of the eggs (e.g., the absence of a membrane and the shape of the processes).</p>

<h3>A redescription of <i>Polystoma africanum </i>Szidat, 1932 (Monogenea: Polystomatidae)</h3>
<i>Martins S. O. Aisien</i>, <i>Louis H. Du Preez</i><h4>Pages: 37-46</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] <i>Polystoma</i> <i>africanum</i> was originally described from a single specimen recovered from the common African toad, <i>Amietophrynus</i> <i>regularis.</i> The parasite has also been reported from the Angola river frog, <i>Amietia</i> <i>angolensis,</i> in Ethiopia; the Mascarene ridged frog, <i>Ptychadena</i> <i>mascareniensis,</i> in Uganda; and <i>Ptychadena</i> <i>sp.</i> in Zaire. One of the characters ascribed to this species was the lack of caecal anastomoses. Based on this and other characteristics, other polystomes from frog species like <i>Pty.</i> <i>mascareniensis</i> have been identified as <i>P.</i> <i>africanum.</i> A large collection of parasite specimens retrieved from <i>A.</i> <i>regularis</i> collected in Nigeria allowed a thorough re-examination of the species. A good proportion of the specimens (37%) correspond closely with the type in lacking intercaecal anastomoses. Other specimens showed considerable variation in this regard by possessing one to four intercaecal anastomoses. An unusual feature observed in several specimens is where two adjacent medial diverticula on one side join to form a loop. The type specimen also has a loop. The handle and guard of the hamuli are well separated, as in the type specimen from Liberia, and in other specimens from <i>A.</i> <i>regularis</i> (syn. <i>Bufo</i> <i>regularis)</i> in Uganda. The mean hamuli length of 388μm is close to the 370μm recorded for the type species, but this value is considerably smaller than the 459μm recorded for the specimens from <i>Pty.</i> <i>mascareniensis</i> in Uganda. On the basis of the aforementioned and invoking strict host specificity, we conclude that <i>P.</i> <i>africanum</i> is exclusively parasitic in <i>A.</i> <i>regularis,</i> and that the polystomes retrieved from <i>Pty.</i> <i>mascareniensis</i> from Uganda and a <i>Ptychadena</i> sp. from Zaire are most likely <i>Polystoma</i> <i>pricei.</i> The materials from <i>A.</i> <i>angolensis</i> most likely represent another species.</p>

<h3>Public online databases as a tool of collaborative taxonomy: a case study on subteranean amphipods</h3>
<i>Cene FiEr</i>, <i>Boris Sket</i>, <i>Martin Turjak</i>, <i>Peter Trontelj</i><h4>Pages: 47-56</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Public databases are a promising tool for collaborative taxonomy. A collaborative revision requires a number of decisions, which – unlike in individual work – need to be clarified in advance. The success of such initiatives depends on acceptable guidelines for possible-yet-unknown participants. The nature of morphological variation constrains the scope of this kind of taxonomy to a level of single genera or families. The database should contain information also on sub and infra-subspecific taxa in order to preserve their identity and retain full knowledge of morphological diversity. All information on morphological variation to be included in the open-access database needs to be subject to peer-review, e.g. in the form of species descriptions. We expect the Web-accessed morphological databases to centralize and unify scattered taxonomical efforts, to foster taxonomy of difficult taxa, to provide free identification aids, and to condense the publication-citation cycle in the notoriously undercited field of alpha taxonomy. Specific issues are illustrated by the case of the amphipod family Niphargidae <i>(http://niphargus.info/).</i></p>

<h3>Diversity of Siphonophora (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) in the Western Caribbean Sea: new records from deep-water trawls</h3>
<i>Rebeca Gasca</i><h4>Pages: 60-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Siphonophores are one of the least known gelatinous zooplankters in the tropical waters of the Northwestern Atlantic. Most of the regional knowledge about their diversity and distribution is based on surface samples (0–200 m). Siphonophores were collected from oceanic waters off the Mexican Caribbean across an expanded sampling range (0–940 m) during two cruises and were taxonomically examined. A total of 47 siphonophore species were recorded, of these, 14 had not been found in this sector of the Caribbean Sea and 10 represent new records for the Caribbean Basin. The number of species currently known from the western Caribbean is increased from 42 to 56. Some of these species also represent new records for the Northwestern Tropical Atlantic region. The greatest relative increase was observed among species of <i>Lensia,</i> five of which are exclusively deep-living forms dwelling below 300 m. A revised, expanded checklist of the siphonophores of the Western Caribbean is also provided. These results confirm the need of further deep sampling to increase our understanding of Caribbean siphonophore diversity.</p>
