<h3>Recognizing diversity in blennioid fish nomenclature (Teleostei: Blennioidei)</h3>
<i>Philip A. Hastings</i>, <i>Victor G. Springer</i><h4>Pages: 3-14</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Species inventories for macroecology, biogeography and conservation biology rely upon accurate lists of valid species. In order to provide a more uniform taxonomic treatment for blennioid fishes, we evaluated the taxonomic status of 21 species with currently recognized subspecies. In six cases we found no compelling evidence for recognizing these nominal forms as distinct species. However, in 15 cases, evidence exists for elevating 17 subspecies to full species status based on currently used criteria for delimiting fish species. This evidence includes the existence of significant phenotypic and/or genetic differences supporting the hypothesis that they are on distinct evolutionary pathways in accordance with a phylogenetic species concept. Known distributions of affected species are modified accordingly. Most of these elevated species are separated from their closest relatives by well-known biogeographic barriers.</p>

<h3>A new species of <i>Phasmahyla </i>Cruz, 1990 from the Atlantic Forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Amphibia, Hylidae, Phyllomedusinae)</h3>
<i>Ana Maria Paulino Telles De Carvalho-E-Silva</i>, <i>Guilherme Ramos Da Silva</i>, <i>Sergio Potsch De Carvalho-E-Silva</i><h4>Pages: 15-26</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] A new species of the genus <i>Phasmahyla</i> Cruz, 1990 is described from the state of Rio de Janeiro in southeastern Brazil, and is compared with the other six species of the genus. The new species, <i>Phasmahyla</i> <i>cruzi,</i> is characterized by its small size, males measuring from 30.5 mm to 34.2 mm, and a female 41.6 mm; smooth skin; inner parts of legs and flanks slightly orange-colored, with numerous small, round, violet blotches; inner areas of the hands and feet slightly orange, and outer areas green with small round violet blotches; tympanum partially covered by the supratympanic fold; snout short and truncated; large eyes; palpebral membrane with white reticulation, pigmented over their entire area; combined lengths of the femur and tibia are greater than the mean snout-vent length; tarsus large, with the outer margin smooth or slightly crenulated; males with a visible nuptial pad from the base of the first finger to the inner carpal tubercle; tadpoles with one to three white spots on the distal third of the tail musculature; tail fins higher than the body, tail length equal to 67% of total body length; oral disc large and wide, with reduced indentation on dorsal margin and no indentation on ventral margin; tooth row formula 0-1/2(1); total length from 40.1 mm to 46.4 mm in stage 37. The new species was found above 200 m asl, from the municipalities of Mangaratiba to Parati, state of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<h3>A new species of <i>Microtityus </i>Kjellesvig-Waering (Scorpiones: Buthidae) from northern Colombia</h3>
<i>Ricardo Botero-Trujillo</i>, <i>Martha C. Erazo-Moreno</i>, <i>Gustavo A. Pérez</i><h4>Pages: 27-38</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] <i>Microtityus</i> <i>bivicentorum</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> is described based on two adult specimens of both sexes from a single locality near the city of Valledupar, northern Colombia. The new species is most similar to <i>Microtityus</i> <i>desuzeae</i> González-Sponga, 2001 and <i>Microtityus</i> <i>joseantonioi</i> González-Sponga, 1981 from Venezuela, and <i>Microtityus</i> <i>franckei</i> Botero-Trujillo & Noriega, 2008 from Colombia, with which it shares the absence of trichobothrium <i>d</i> <i>2</i> on femur, <i>Eb</i> <i>3</i> and <i>Esb</i> on pedipalp chela, and <i>esb</i> on fixed finger. With this description, the number of extant species of <i>Microtityus</i> is raised to 25, of which eleven are present in South America and two in Colombia. A map with the known distribution of <i>M.</i> <i>bivicentorum</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> and similar species is presented. Some remarks about the trichobothrial arrangement of <i>M.</i> <i>joseantonioi</i> are also included.</p>

<h3>The genus <i>Leptodora </i>Lilljeborg (Crustacea: Branchiopoda: Cladocera) is not monotypic: description of a new species from the Amur River basin (Far East of Russia)</h3>
<i>Nikolai M. Korovchinsky</i><h4>Pages: 39-52</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] New species, <i>Leptodora</i> <i>richardi</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> is described from some large lakes and other water bodies of the Lower Amur River basin. It differs from <i>L.</i> <i>kindtii</i> Focke, the only species known in this genus until now, by a smaller body size and proportions of some body parts, namely a comparatively longer head and shorter abdomen, and by presence of fine setules on the end of anterior distal seta of second segment of thoracic limbs of first pair. Small differences in male features require further elucidation. Among the investigated populations of <i>L.</i> <i>kindtii,</i> one of them from the Volga Delta was analyzed in more detail due to the unusually small size of their adults, comparable with those of <i>L.</i> <i>richardi</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.,</b> but had body proportions characteristic of the former species and probably represented its extreme morpho-ecological variation. <i>L.</i> <i>kindtii</i> is widely distributed in Palearctic, while <i>L.</i> <i>richardi</i> <b>sp.</b> <b>nov.</b> seems to be an endemic of East Asia probably distributed from the Lower Amur River in the Far East of Russia to Eastern China and Japan (Honshu Island) in the south.</p>

<h3>Report on some <i>Plesionika </i>Bate, 1888 and first record of <i>Stylopandalus</i> Coutiére, 1905 (Caridea, Pandalidae) from Brazilian waters</h3>
<i>Irene Cardoso</i><h4>Pages: 53-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The Brazilian expeditions REVIZEE Central Fishery and Campos Basin Deep Sea Environmental Project collected samples from the southwestern Atlantic, between depths from 200 to 2200m. These expeditions sampled three <i>Plesionika</i> Bate, 1888 species: <i>Plesionika</i> <i>edwardsii</i> (Brandt, 1851), <i>P.</i> <i>ensis</i> (A. Milne Edwards, 1881) and <i>P.</i> <i>miles</i> (A. Milne Edwards, 1883). Besides that, one species of <i>Stylopandalus</i> Coutiére, 1905, a genus never recorded on Brazilian coast before, was collected. These four pandalids were redescribed and figured.</p>
