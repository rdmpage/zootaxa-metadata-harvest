<h3>Acoustic and morphological identification of the sympatric cricket frogs <i>Acris crepitans </i>and <i>A. gryllus </i>and the disappearance of <i>A. gryllus </i>near the edge of its range</h3>
<i>Jonathan P. Micancin</i>, <i>Jeff T. Mette</i><h4>Pages: 1-36</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] Although the Northern Cricket Frog, <i>Acris</i> <i>crepitans,</i> and Blanchard’s Cricket Frog, <i>A.</i> <i>c</i> <i>blanchardi</i> <i>or</i> <i>A.</i> <i>blanchardi,</i> have declined in areas near the northern margins of their ranges in the eastern and central United States, no such declines have been reported for the Southern Cricket Frog, <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus,</i> at the northern margin of its range in the Southeast. However, the status of <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> is obscured by its sympatry with <i>A.</i> <i>crepitans</i> and the difficulty of identifying the two species. To address these difficulties, we studied <i>A.</i> <i>crepitans</i> and <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> from North Carolina in the field and in a large museum collection. We quantified distinct differences in the click components of the vocalizations of <i>A.</i> <i>crepitans</i> and <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> and used these differences to identify calling males from field recordings. Based on field recording and collection, we developed a discriminant function to identify preserved specimens by the extent of hind-foot webbing and the diameter of anal tubercles. During surveys from 2004 to 2007, we found that <i>Acris</i> <i>crepitans</i> was more widespread than expected from published reports, as it was frequently found in the Coastal Plain. <i>Acris</i> <i>gryllus</i> was less widespread than expected, as we could not find it in the northern part of the upper Coastal Plain, where published reports indicated it should occur. By applying our discriminant function to <i>Acris</i> collected in 1962 and 1963, we confirmed that <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> once occurred in this area. In 2008, we resurveyed sites where <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> had once occurred alone or in syntopy with <i>A.</i> <i>crepitans</i> and confirmed that <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> is now missing from three major river basins in the upper Coastal Plain of North Carolina. We conclude that while the range of <i>A.</i> <i>crepitans</i> is stable in North Carolina, <i>A.</i> <i>gryllus</i> has disappeared from a large area near the northern edge of its range.</p>

<h3>Descriptions of three new species of <i>Melanochromis </i>(Teleostei: Cichlidae) and a redescription of <i>M. vermivorus</i></h3>
<i>Gertrud Konings-Dudin</i>, <i>Adrianus F. Konings</i>, <i>Jay R. Stauffer</i>, <i>Jr </i><h4>Pages: 37-59</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] The Lake Malaŵi genus <i>Melanochromis</i> included five species at its inception and was originally distinguished from <i>Pseudotropheus</i> on the basis of morphology including the arrangement of pharyngeal teeth. The diagnosis has been extended twice, first to include all elongate mbuna that possess horizontal stripes and U-shaped tooth bands and later to exclude mbuna that do not exhibit a sex-related reversal in their color pattern. We have further refined the diagnosis of the genus on the basis of the melanin pattern, resolved a longstanding dispute regarding the validity of <i>M.</i> <i>heterochromis,</i> re-evaluated the status of <i>M.</i> <i>vermivorus,</i> synonymized <i>M.</i> <i>mellitus</i> Johnson 1976 with <i>M.</i> <i>melanopterus</i> Trewavas 1935, moved <i>M.</i> <i>benetos</i> Bowers and Stauffer 1977 to <i>Pseudotropheus,</i> and described <i>M.</i> <i>kaskazini,</i> <i>M.</i> <i>wochepa,</i> and <i>M.</i> <i>mossambiquensis</i> from the eastern shore of the lake. <i>Melanochromis</i> is still paraphyletic as two species, <i>M.</i> <i>joanjohnsonae</i> Johnson 1974 and <i>M.</i> <i>labrosus</i> Trewavas 1935, are not congruent with the rest of the group, but, currently, a better alternative for these two could not be found.</p>

<h3>Revision of <i>Biserovus xiae </i>Li, Su & Yu, 2004 (Tardigrada: Macrobiotidae)</h3>
<i>Xiaochen Li</i><h4>Pages: 63-68</h4>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>[en_US] <i>Biserovus</i> <i>xiae</i> Li, Su & Yu is re-described and assigned to the genus <i>Insuetifurca.</i> <i>I.</i> <i>xiae</i> <b>comb.</b> <b>nov.</b> (Li, Su & Yu, 2004) differs from <i>I.</i> <i>arrowsmithi</i> (Kathman & Nelson, 1989) by having a much lower <i>pt</i> of the pharyngeal tube and by the presence of a crescent-shaped cuticular bar behind the double claws on the first three pairs of legs; <i>I.</i> <i>xiae</i> differs from <i>I.</i> <i>fujiense</i> (Ito, 1997) by having macroplacoids equal in length or the second is the shortest instead of the macroplacoids increasing in length from the first to the third and by the presence of a crescent-shaped cuticular bar behind the double claws on the first three pairs of legs.</p>
